              <h3>About</h3>
              <p>
                Skoden Indigenous Film Festival is a Vancouver-based film festival which was created to showcase Canadian Indigenous creators, celebrate their voices and cultivate active discussion about reconciliation. The festival is run as a group-based student-centered course at SFU in organizing the film festival. Social Media posts were organized by class's Marketing Committee.

              <h3>My Role</h3>
              <p>
                I took the role of lead designer when it came to SIFF's social media posts. I led group meetings to discuss about logotype, colour schemes and our overall social media template. Designed numerous posts myself. As well as gave feedback and correct my teammate’s posts to make sure all designs matched each other visually.

            <section id="concept">
              <h3>Concept</h3>
              <p>
                Our instructors wanted us to create a new design from scratch for 2023 compared to the previous years the only thing they wanted to keep the same was our logo which is used throughout the years.

                These social media posts were to be put on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter to adapt to their formats we maintained a square format throughout them all. Social media banners and posters also had to be designed.

              <p>
                We initiated work by creating concept boards on Canva looking at what students did in previous years and finding work which inspired us. Likewise we made boards and discussed possible fonts, colours schemes.

                Being an open course a lot of the design team didn’t have brand level experience so I took the role as the group leader. I wanted to make sure that all voices were heard while also teaching my groupmates about the importance hierarchy and design. Using this we whittled down our options and showed these potential options were shown to class

              <h4>MILESTONE 02 — Refined Design Document (1 Week)</h4>
              <p>
                Based on feedback we received the week prior, we were told we liked the casual friendly vibe our blue concept had with the sans-serif interface.<br>
                We were decided to use the colours scheme based on Minty C.’s ideations as our main brand colours. As well as to have a total of four different colour schemes. This was somewhat daunting at first but I came up with the concept that all four colour schemes should blend together to make a rainbow. 
              </p>

              </div>
              
              <p>A happy accident from this choice our recurring guest Squamish Nation Elder, Xwechtaal Dennis Joseph noted that the four colour schemes reminded him of the Four Directions as seen on The Medicine Wheel used by various Indigenous tribes.</p>
              
              <h4>MILESTONE 03 — Refined Logotype and Banner (1 Week)</h4>
              <p>After receiving some critique from our SFU staff social media team. We reworked our logotype to be more unique and interesting. Due to our team not owning the Adobe Suite I exported the different layers of the posts as PNG files that could be layered together in Canva. With this I also created a template guide to follow.</p>

              <h4>MILESTONE 04 — Posts are Live (8 Weeks)</h4>
              <p>
                We created our posts in mind to be quickly digestible while not diluting the important discussion the effects of colonialism had on Canada. In a usual post I would receive the full text or rough notes of what should be told. Then I found the images for the post and began designing following our template.<br>

              <h3>Challenges</h3>
              <p>
                A big challenge I felt was the constant time crunch we were under. We were told that usually film festival such as these were organized through the year instead of in a single semester. This meant that the work schedule was very tight and had to be made in very short notice. Early into posting there were instances I’d receive messages during the weekend telling me I had under 24 hours to design a post. Though organization was heavily improved as we moved forward and communicated our needs better.
